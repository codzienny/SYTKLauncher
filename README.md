Simple application configuration goes like this:

2. Press *"Set my deck directory"* and then choose a directory where you want to keep your deck files.
3. Press *"Set shared deck directory"* and then choose a directory where shared deck files will be kept (cloud based directories shared with friends, like those shared via Dropbox, a recommended)

# Instruction: basic usage explanation

***Deck swapping***

If you want to swap between directories, simply press *"Use my decks"* or *"Use shared decks"* buttons. If deckfiles are in subdirectories, then you should use dropdown list next to the button related to main directory.

> Note: If you wanna swap decks during ProjectIgnis usage, remember to go back to ProjectIgnis main menu, because it needs to reload decks after they are swapped.
